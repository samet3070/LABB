We can’t rely on CPU execution time to measure algorithm efficiency because it depends on factors outside the algorithm itself. Different computers have different processors, memory, and system loads, which affect how long a program takes to run. Even on the same machine, background processes or compiler optimizations can change the timing. Programming languages and runtime environments also influence execution speed. Since these factors make time measurements inconsistent, we use asymptotic analysis (like Big O notation) to describe efficiency. This approach focuses on how the algorithm’s running time grows with input size, independent of hardware or environment.
